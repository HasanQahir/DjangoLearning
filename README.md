A small web app created using Django to learn the framework. Followed the beginner's tutorial for Django available on the website to create the Poll-management side, and utilised the VS Code tutorial Docs for the message logger side.

This project contains 2 apps:

A simple message log, which stores its messages in the associated sqlite3 database and automatically displays the most recent messages as well as their creation date/time.

A simple polling + voting feature. Poll creation may only be done using django's admin panel or using a terminal during development. Voting is freely accessible and tracks user votes.
